# LOLFiend

LOL Fiend is an Android application used specifically to search for League of Legends Summoner information.

LOL Fiend makes use of the Riot Games API and the built-in Android JSON libraries (along with other few apis) to retrieve information
regarding Summoners and their recent match history.

The app is currently in its first stage of development.
